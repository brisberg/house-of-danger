House of Danger is based on the game rules from the [House of Danger](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/251420/choose-your-own-adventure-house-danger) board game.

This is a choose-your-own-adventure story game involving branching story paths, and random dice rolls to resolve encounters. The story itself is static, so repeated play throughs will be the same events.
