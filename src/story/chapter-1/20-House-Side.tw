:: House Side
  Running along the side of the house, you discover that it is a tight squeeze between the house and the fence. You almost have to shuffle sideways to make it through, which makes you claustrophobic.
  Out of nowhere, you hear the sound of a lone violin playing a gorgeous, flowing melody with expert skill and confidence.
  There is a clearing up ahead, though you are unsure of what lies at its end. And the space you are in has become so tight, it would be easier to climb over the fence to check out the violinist playing that amazing melody.

If you run towards the clearing, go to [[Story Card 30|Marsden House]].
If you climb over the fence to follow the violin melody, go to [[Story Card 17|Stable]].
