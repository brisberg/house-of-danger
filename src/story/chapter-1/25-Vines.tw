:: Vines
  As soon as you take a step towards the vines, one of them lashes out and wraps around your neck. Then another whips around your waist. More and more vines spring out at you.
  This isn't really happening, you think.
  The vines are moving all around you, spinning you into a cocoon. You struggle to break free of them, but they only tighten their grip on you. This can't be real! Eventually, you can't breathe. Everything seems to turn a deep green, then you see a bright white light--and then you no longer exist.
