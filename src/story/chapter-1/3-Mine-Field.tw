:: Mine Field
  You only make it a few steps across the open field before you head a clicking sound from around your feet that freezes you in your tracks. Looking down, you see freshly disturbed earth around your sneakers, as though someone had recently buried something there.
  As you lift your foot to look--KA-KLICK!--the reality of the situation becomes clear. You have just stepped on a landmind.
  A noise like thunder, infinitely loud, rings out, but you never even hear it. Instantly, everything goes black.
