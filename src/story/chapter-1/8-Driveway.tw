:: Driveway
  Your heart pounding, you bolt up the driveway, which bends around the back side of the manor. After running about fifty yards, you slow down, out of breath. Gasping for air, you stop at a large wall of thorny hedges lining one side of the driveway. You hear water trickling down a ditch on the opposite side of the driveway. Charcoal-gray clouds are massing ominously on the horizon, and the nearby tree branches rattle with sudden gusts of wind.
  Before you can catch your breath, a dark-windowed limousine roars around the bend--you only have a split second to decide which way to go to avoid being hit!

If you dash through the hedges, go to [[Story Card 15|Bush Garden]].
If you jump into the ditch, go to [[Story Card 26|Ditch]].
