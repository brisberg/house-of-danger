:: Wood Bridge
  After crossing the precarious board, you find yourself at one end of the walkway that spans the length of the greenhouse roof. From here you can see most of the mansion's vast grounds, which are a little out of place amid the surrounding suburban neighborhood. The air is full of mosquitoes and other buzzing insects. The clouds you saw on the horizon earlier seem to be closer now. You see that there's an open access door in the roof that would allow you to descend into the greenhouse. You can also drop down onto a path, which appears to lead to the side of the mansion itself.

If you wriggle through the access door and enter the greenhouse, go to [[Story Card 2|Greenhouse]].
If you drop onto the path and run to the side of the house, go to [[Story Card 20|House Side]].
