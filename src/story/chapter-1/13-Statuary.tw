:: Statuary
  Moving along the mossy stone wall that surrounds the property, you come across a jagged opening created by fallen rocks--it's just big enough for you to squeeze through. Once on the other side of the wall, you find yourself standing in a cobblestone plaza surrounded by markble and bronze figures. Most of the scultures depict men gazing off into the distance as if pondering the deeper meaning of it all, but at the edge of the courtyard is a monumental statue of a man atop a muscular steed.
  To your right, a stony pathway leads away from the statuary and into a picturesque garden, where topiary bushes have been trimmed into whimsical shapes.
