:: Tunnel Collapse
  Without warning, the earthen walls begin to collapse around you, and before you can react, you are up to your waist in dirt. You writhe and twist, trying to escape, but it only causes more soil to cascade down. Soon it's up to your shoulders, then your neck, then your cheeks. You struggle to spit the soil out as it fills your mouth, but within moments you are fully buried. You can only see the dark earth in front of your eys. Your hand closes around a metal disc--perhaps a coin? You'll never know, though, as the soil gills your lungs, and the world wavers and goes gray before finally turning black.
