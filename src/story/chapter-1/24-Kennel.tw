:: Kennel
  You tiptoe through the open gate, eager to hear the finale of the chimp's violin piece. Quietly... quietly...
  With your third step, you trigger a motion-sensor light that completely illuminates the interior of the building. Apparently, this is no stable: it's a kennel. Twenty Doberman Pinschers were peacefully enjoying the convert, but now they glate at you with anger in their eyes.
  The chimp frowns and slowly points his violin bow towards you. The Dobermans respond and rush to attack you and then eat you alive. The last think you see is the chimpanzee violinist laughing at your fate. So embarassing!
