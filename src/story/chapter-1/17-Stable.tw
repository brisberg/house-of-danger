:: Stable
  You move further and further toward the hypnotic sound of the distant violin, which is oddly calming and uplifting even as the winds increase around you. You notice there is a driveway up in the distance, but before you get there, you arrive at a horse stable with an open gate. Inside, sitting on a stool, is the source of the violin music: a chimpanzee playing his heart out, a soulful expression on his face.
  The chimp is fully committed to the music. You have never heard such an emotional performance.
  It's... it's beautiful.

If you leave the stable and run to the driveway, go to [[Story Card 30|Marsden House]].
If you tiptoe through the gate to experience the full power of the performance, go to [[Story Card 24|Kennel]].
